# S23 - reload-then-quit: a config reload keeps the session, and SIGTERM then
# ends it gracefully (clean shutdown log, no crash marker).
#
# The graceful path: SIGTERM -> signal self-pipe -> utils.quit -> event loop
# returns -> "Shutting down gracefully..." (src/main.zig) -> clean exit. A
# crash (SIGSEGV/SIGBUS) would additionally drop ~/hana-crash.log next to the
# harness's private $HOME; its absence proves the quit was intentional.
