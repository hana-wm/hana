//! ONLY this module (via its wire sink) sends geometry/border/map/stack
//! requests. Pure orchestration lives here; every raw XCB request lives in
//! the sink file, the sanctioned boundary. Raw libxcb symbols may appear only
//! inside its send shims. Sink shims are defined in sink.zig.
//!
//! Scroll viewport caller duties (snap-right-on-new, clamp, prev_count update)
//! happen in ACTIONS before they call reconcile; this module never mutates
//! model params (m is const).
//!
//! RECONCILE ALGORITHM - UNCONDITIONAL COMPUTE, DELTA SEND. Every pass
//! computes the desired state for EVERY stored window (so a client that
//! mutated its own geometry/border behind our back is repaired on the very
//! next pass -- drift-proof by construction, no diff cache, no sweep counter,
//! no staging buffer). The SEND is then diffed against the sent ledger: a
//! request whose desired value matches the last one sent is elided, because
//! resending an idempotent configure/map/park request is a pure no-op the X
//! server would discard. Parked windows get ONE merged park request only on
//! the park transition; visible windows send only the map/pixel/bw/geometry
//! requests that actually changed, in the order map -> pixel -> bw -> geometry
//! (stacking mode merged into the geometry request). Sending full desired
//! state on change is still drift-proofing; we only avoid replaying what the
//! server already has.
//!
//! The SENT LEDGER is a WRITE-ONLY record of what was actually sent
//! ({rect, has_rect, parked} per window; a park flips `parked` and preserves
//! rect/has_rect). Exactly three reads of it are behavioral contract:
//!   1. Multi-tag orphans: kept at their previous real geometry
//!      rather than parking. A history-less orphan parks (first sight /
//!      registered offscreen).
//!   2. Winner-raise derivation: rides .above ONLY when geometry moved,
//!      when it unparked, or under force_restack, derived by comparing the
//!      new rect against the ledger and reading its parked flag.
//!   3. Floating-detach / title prefetch (actions.lastRectFor,
//!      sync.truthRect): the live rect as the new floating base, null while
//!      parked.
