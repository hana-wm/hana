//! Floating layout — windows are left at their current positions.
//!
//! Switching to this layout lets windows be moved and resized freely without
//! any tiling engine interference.  The layout engine is still active (windows
//! remain tracked in tiling.State), so switching back to a tiling layout
//! retiles all tracked windows immediately.
//!
//! Interface
//! ─────────
//! floating follows the same tileWithOffset interface as every other layout
//! module.  Windows that have already been positioned (x or y ≠ 0) are left
//! untouched.  Windows still at the X default origin (0, 0) — i.e. freshly
//! spawned while floating was active — are centred on the screen.
//!
//! Prev-layout state
//! ─────────────────
//! The layout to restore when floating is exited is stored in tiling.State
//! (State.prev_layout) rather than here, so this module stays free of a
//! circular dependency with tiling.zig.
