//! Window minimization: hide/restore with LIFO, FIFO, or bulk restore.
//!
//! Minimized windows remain in their workspace's window list so the bar
//! keeps rendering them, but they are moved offscreen and removed from
//! tiling so remaining windows fill the freed space.
//!
//! Three restore operations are provided, all scoped to the current workspace:
//!   unminimize(.lifo): restore the most recently minimized window (stack pop)
//!   unminimize(.fifo): restore the least recently minimized window (queue dequeue)
//!   unminimizeAll:     restore every minimized window on the current workspace
//!
//! Ordering is tracked via a monotonic per-entry timestamp — no separate
//! per-workspace ordered lists are maintained.  Scanning the fixed buffer for
//! the LIFO/FIFO candidate is O(n), but n is always tiny in practice (typically
//! < 10 minimized windows), the entire buffer fits in cache, and there is no
//! hashing cost, no heap pointer chase, and no allocator dependency.
//!
//! Fullscreen interaction: minimizing a fullscreen window tears down the
//! fullscreen state but saves the pre-fullscreen geometry. Restoring such
//! a window puts it back into fullscreen exactly as it was.
//!
//! NOTE: init() is now infallible (void return).  Callers that previously did
//! `try minimize.init()` should change the call to `minimize.init()`.
