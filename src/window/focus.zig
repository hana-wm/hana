///
/// The previous implementation accepted any FocusIn for a managed window as a
/// legitimate focus change and called commitFocusTransition to update
/// g_focused_window.  This created a subtle, hard-to-diagnose hover-focus bug:
///
///   1. g_focused_window = terminal  (user was using terminal)
///   2. Discord's Electron runtime calls XSetInputFocus spontaneously
///      (Electron does this for internal bookkeeping, notifications, startup, etc.)
///   3. FocusIn(discord) arrives → handleFocusIn updates g_focused_window = discord
///   4. User hovers mouse over discord
///   5. setFocus(discord, .mouse_enter): g_focused_window == discord → EARLY RETURN
///   6. XSetInputFocus and WM_TAKE_FOCUS are NEVER sent — discord's Electron
///      runtime never gets the WM focus protocol and never properly activates.
///
/// The fix (matching dwm's focusin):
///   If a FocusIn arrives for any window other than g_focused_window, re-push
///   focus back to g_focused_window.  The WM is the authority; unsolicited app
///   grabs are rejected and corrected.
///
/// This is safe for all legitimate focus transitions because setFocus /
/// commitFocusTransition sets g_focused_window = new_win BEFORE the FocusIn
/// arrives.  When FocusIn(new_win) comes in during a normal hover or click,
/// g_focused_window == new_win → early return.  The re-assertion path is only
/// reached when an app grabs focus the WM did not intend.
///
/// It is also safe for globally_active apps (which MUST call XSetInputFocus
