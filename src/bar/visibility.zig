//! Bar visibility decisions
//!
//! The bar visibility subsystem's POLICY half: every decision about when the
//! bar is shown/hidden -- fullscreen-occupancy reactions, workspace-scoped
//! recomputation, prompt forced-show/undo, and the shared-screen predicate
//! behind them -- lives here as pure computations over the core model.
//!
//! This partition issues NO X11 requests. The eponymous `bar.zig` imports it
//! one-way (bar -> visibility), applies a decision, and performs the
//! map/unmap + screen-claim + reconcile glue; visibility.zig never imports
//! bar.zig, so every wire token stays in the orchestrator.
