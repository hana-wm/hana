//! Carousel / ticker logic for the title segment.
//!
//! A "carousel" is a pre-rendered XCB pixmap that is wider than the available
//! area.  Every frame, a window into that pixmap is blitted via xcb_copy_area
//! using a time-derived offset, producing a smooth horizontal scroll.
//!
//! V-sync alignment
//! ────────────────
//! The scroll offset is quantised to monitor frame boundaries so that the
//! destination pixels change at most once per frame.  This eliminates the
//! sub-pixel drift that occurs when the bar redraws mid-frame and ensures
//! that every visible update coincides with a v-blank interval.
//!
//!   frame_duration = 1 000 ms / hz
//!   pixels_per_frame = CAROUSEL_PX_PER_S / hz
//!   frame_number = floor(elapsed_ms / frame_duration)
//!   offset = (frame_number × pixels_per_frame)  mod  cycle_w
//!
//! The pixmap is only rebuilt when the window ID changes or the title is
//! invalidated — the hot path is always two xcb_copy_area blits.
//!
//! Leapfrog wrap
//! ─────────────
//! Two logical copies of the text sit `cycle_w` apart in the pixmap.  As
//! `offset` advances 0 → cycle_w the first copy exits left while the second
//! enters right.  At cycle_w the state is identical to 0 → seamless loop.
//!
//!   cycle_w = text_w + CAROUSEL_GAP_PX
