//! Shared bar vocabulary for the segment modules.
//!
//! This is NOT a bar segment module: it holds the type-free vocabulary every
//! segment module (and bar.zig) imports -- `Frame` (live workspace visitability),
//! `DrawCtx` (the per-frame scratch bar builds for each segment's draw), the
//! title render/snapshot machinery, and the prompt service-handle struct.
//!
//! Segments are discovered under the bar's `modules/` directory and register
//! into the build-generated `bar_modules.modules` array; the bar orchestrator
//! iterates that array with uniform loops. This file sits beside them (not
//! inside the scanned dir) so it is never itself registered.
//!
//! Rendering uses per-segment dirty tracking: only dirty segments are
//! repainted on each frame, and the dirty set is registry-sized.
